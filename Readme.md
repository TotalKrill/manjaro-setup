# Majaro setup script
This is just a small script that will install programs I use and also
apply configs that i am using under the Manjaro-i3 community edition.

The idea being that by running this script, most stuff I need and use will be
installed and setup.

To run:

wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TotalKrill/manjaro-setup/master/script-init.sh -O install.sh && chmod +x install.sh && bash -c ./install.sh && rm install.sh
